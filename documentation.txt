To use KeyMapPlusConfigTool, begin by entering your shortcut in the text field on the left and your command in the field on the right.
For instance, let's say you wanted to make pressing "a" have the effect of pressing "b".
In the field on the left, you would type "a", while in the field on the right, you would type "b".
Please note that case does not matter.
You can only enter one key per field. If you want "a" to have the effect of pressing "b" and "c", use the following instructions:
Bind "a" to "b" as detailed above. Then, press "Add New Keybind", and bind "a" to "c".
Now, pressing "a" will have the effect of pressing "b", followed immediately by "c".
If you want to make "a" send the command for "c" followed by "b" instead of "b" followed by "c", simply bind "a" to "c" before you bind it to "b".
Keybinds don't have to be grouped together. For example, you can bind "a" to "b", "d" to "e", then "a" to "c".
You can generate your .ino file by pressing "Compile!". The "Uncompiled" text at the top should change to "Successfully compiled!".
Mac OS uses the command key where other operating systems use the control key.
If you are using the control key in a keybind, you must check "Compile for Mac" if it will be run on a Mac, and uncheck it otherwise.
The checkbox will default to the operating system KeyMapPlusConfigTool is being run on.
